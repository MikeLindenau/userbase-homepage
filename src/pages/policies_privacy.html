    <h3>
      <li><span class="ml-4">Identity & Access</span></li>
    </h3>

    <p>When you sign up for Userbase, we ask for your full legal name, email address, and password. That's just so you can login to your account, use the features of Userbase, and for us to send you invoices, updates, or other essential information. We will never sell your information to third parties, and we won’t use your name in marketing statements without your permission.</p>

    <p>When you pay for Userbase, we ask for your credit card and billing address. That's so we can charge you for the service, calculate taxes due, and send you invoices. Your credit card is passed directly to our payment processor (<a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>) and doesn't ever go through our servers. We store a record of the payment transaction for account history, invoicing, and billing support. We store your billing address to calculate any sales tax due in the United States, to detect fraudulent credit card transactions, and to print on your invoices.</p>

    <p>When you contact Userbase with a question or to ask for help, we will keep that correspondence and the email address for future reference. When you browse our website and marketing pages, we may track that for statistical purposes (like conversion rates and to test new designs). We also store any information you volunteer, like surveys, for as long as it makes sense.</p>

    <p>The only times we’ll ever share your info:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-outside">
      <li>To provide products or services you've requested, with your permission. <a href="/policies/subprocessors">List of third-party services we use</a>.</li>
      <li>To investigate, prevent, or take action regarding illegal activities, suspected fraud, situations involving potential threats to the physical safety of any person, violations of our <a href="/policies/terms">Terms of Service</a>, or as otherwise required by law.</li>
      <li>If Userbase is acquired by or merged with another company, we will notify you well before any info about you is transferred and becomes subject to a different privacy policy.</li>
    </ul>

    <h3>
      <li><span class="ml-4">Your Rights With Respect to Your Information</span></li>
    </h3>

    <p>You may have heard about the General Data Protection Regulation ("GDPR") in Europe. GDPR gives people under its protection certain rights with respect to their personal information collected by us from this website. Accordingly, Userbase recognizes and will comply with GDPR. Your rights under GDPR include:</p>

    <ul class="list-disc list-outside">
      <li><strong>Right of Access.</strong> This includes your right to access the personal information we gather about you, and your right to obtain information about the sharing, storage, security, and processing of that information.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Correction.</strong> This is your right to request correction of your personal information.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Erasure.</strong> This is your right to request, subject to certain limitations under applicable law, that your personal information be erased from our possession (also known as the "Right to be forgotten"). However, if applicable law requires us to comply with your request to delete your information, fulfillment of your request may prevent you from using Userbase and may result in closing your account.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Complain.</strong> You have the right to make a complaint regarding our handling of your personal information with the appropriate supervisory authority.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Restrict Processing.</strong> This is your right to request restriction of how and why your personal information is used or processed.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Object.</strong> This is your right, in certain situations, to object to how or why your personal information is processed.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to Portability.</strong> This is your right to receive the personal information we have about you and the right to transmit it to another party.</li>
      <li><strong>Right to not be subject to Automated Decision-Making.</strong> This is your right to object and prevent any decision that could have a legal, or similarly significant, effect on you from being made solely based on automated processes. This right is limited, however, if the decision is necessary for performance of any contract between you and us, is allowed by applicable European law, or is based on your explicit consent.</li>
    </ul>

    <p>Many of these rights can be exercised by signing in and directly updating your account information. If you have questions about exercising these rights or need assistance, please contact us at <a href="mailto:privacy@userbase.com">privacy@userbase.com</a>.</p>


    <h3>
      <li><span class="ml-4">Processors We Use</span></li>
    </h3>

    <p>As part of the services we provide, and only to the extent necessary, we may use certain third party processors to process some or all of your personal information. For identification of these processors, and where they are located, please see our <a href="/policies/subprocessors">subprocessor listing</a>. We have signed appropriate data processing contracts that comply with GDPR with each processor.</p>

    <h3>
      <li><span class="ml-4">Law Enforcement</span></li>
    </h3>

    <p>Userbase won’t hand your data over to law enforcement unless a court order says we have to. We flat-out reject requests from local and federal law enforcement when they seek data without a court order. And unless we're legally prevented from it, we will always inform you when such requests are made.</p>

    <h3>
      <li><span class="ml-4">Security & Encryption</span></li>
    </h3>

    <p>All data is encrypted via <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transport_Layer_Security">SSL/TLS</a> every time it travels on a network, including when transmitted from our servers to your browser. All data is also encrypted at rest, both when it is live in the database, as well as during backups.</p>

    <h3>
      <li><span class="ml-4">Deleted data</span></li>
    </h3>

    <p>When you cancel your account, we will ensure that nothing is stored on our servers past 30 days. Anything you delete on your account while it's active will also be purged within 30 days.</p>

    <h3>

By using our services or providing us with your information, you consent to this transfer.</p>

    <h3>
      <li><span class="ml-4">Changes & Questions</span></li>
    </h3>

    <p>Userbase may update this policy occassionally. We will notify you about significant changes by emailing the account owner or by placing a prominent notice on the website.
